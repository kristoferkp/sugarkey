## 10/24/2025 - Research  

I will be mostly following the Blueprint dev board guide, but I will substitute out the RP2040 for the RP2350. 
I will make the board smaller as I do not need the headers, and I will make the USB-C connector one of the really long ones you can plug straight into a device.

USB-C needs to be implemented correctly, if I recall correctly, so I will try to search as much as possible about the USB-C standard and common mistakes to avoid. There is a [blog post by JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/blog/pcb-layout-guidelines-for-usb-type-c) that has some tips on how to implement USB-C.

I want to make the board as small as the Waveshare RP2350-Zero Mini, and if possible, even smaller.
![RP2350-Zero-details-size](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTIwOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ec6cfd82ea3c628c263e2f09148955368221d71f/RP2350-Zero-details-size.jpg)

How much storage should the key have? The official RPi Pico 2 has 4Â MB, as does the Waveshare. But wouldn't it be advantageous to have more so I could store more passkeys?
After a bit of searching around, the QSPI doesn't matter that much, so I think I will add 4 MB to be inline with RPi Pico 2.

There is an already developed open source passkey solution for the RP2350 and the ESP32-S3 (and RP2040, but that is not recommended) called Pico Keys, so I will use that.

The Pico Keys uses an LED to display the status of the key, so I will need to add one to my board too. Secondly, the firmware is installed holding the BOOTSEL button down, I want to avoid adding a button, so maybe I can use a pair of tweezers in-place of the buttons BOOTSEL and RESET.

Also, sorry if this has been a bit of a ramble, I wanted to get the ideas off my mind for future reference.
