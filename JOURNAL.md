## 10/24/2025 - Research  

I will be mostly following the Blueprint dev board guide, but I will substitute out the RP2040 for the RP2350. 
I will make the board smaller as I do not need the headers, and I will make the USB-C connector one of the really long ones you can plug straight into a device.

USB-C needs to be implemented correctly, if I recall correctly, so I will try to search as much as possible about the USB-C standard and common mistakes to avoid. There is a [blog post by JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/blog/pcb-layout-guidelines-for-usb-type-c) that has some tips on how to implement USB-C.

I want to make the board as small as the Waveshare RP2350-Zero Mini, and if possible, even smaller.

How much storage should the key have? The official RPi Pico 2 has 4Â MB, as does the Waveshare. But wouldn't it be advantageous to have more so I could store more passkeys?
After a bit of searching around, the QSPI doesn't matter that much, so I think I will add 4 MB to be inline with RPi Pico 2.

There is an already developed open source passkey solution for the RP2350 and the ESP32-S3 (and RP2040, but that is not recommended) called Pico Keys, so I will use that.

The Pico Keys uses an LED to display the status of the key, so I will need to add one to my board too. Secondly, the firmware is installed holding the BOOTSEL button down, I want to avoid adding a button, so maybe I can use a pair of tweezers in-place of the buttons BOOTSEL and RESET.

Also, sorry if this has been a bit of a ramble, I wanted to get the ideas off my mind for future reference.
  

## 10/25/2025 3:41 AM - More research and schematic  

Actually, it turns out I do need to add a BOOTSEL button for the user confirmation, I will try to do so. I have been thinking if I should use the RP2354 with integrated 2 MB flash, or use a RP2350 with 4 MB of QSPI flash.

I have mostly been reading the [RP2350 hardware design guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/hardware-design-with-rp2350.pdf), it is a great read :).

Furthermore, I have decided to use the RP2354 with the integrated flash as it removes one component off the board, making the board itself smaller.

Also, the USB-C connector will be a receptacle and not a port (the one that sticks out), as the PCBA would get really expensive. I guess I will have a small USB-C cable plugged into the device at all times.

Here is the schematic. It was mostly made out of the hardware guide by RPi because the RP2040 has changes that the dev board guide does not account for.

## 10/25/2025 3:50 AM - PCB footprint and routing  

Holy moly, this is via city. The QFN pins make it hard to route the traces and I had to use a lot of vias. That isn't inherently bad, but should be avoided. 

One of the components will be on the underside of the board but as I do not want to pay an arm and a leg for the PCBA, I have decided that I will try to hand solder it.

One of the many problems with my work here is that one capacitor (C2) cannot be moved to the front as that breaks GND planes from being connected. Which is odd, but I have been staying up too late and am too tired for my brain to function.

I will try and solve the issue another day. I did try and see what PCBA Standard would cost and it was almost like 90 euros for 2 boards. That is kind of insane, but with bulk discounts it would be a lot cheaper I would imagine.

As you guys can see, not my finest work, but it should maybe probably hopefully work.
I managed to get the caps as close as I could and I think it looks nifty.

I need to add some sort of drawings or stuff as right now it looks boring.

I would also like to know where all my time has gone! Time flies really fast when I am locking in. I haven't realized that I have been doing this for like 6 or 7 hours now. :)

Okay, bye for now!
